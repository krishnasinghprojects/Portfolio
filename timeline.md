# Developer Journey Timeline

---

## Back to Square One
**Duration:** May 2024  
**Title:** Retracing the Steps  
**Subtitle:** 12th Completed - Back to JAVA The Base  
**Summary:** After completing 12th grade, I decided to go back and strengthen my programming fundamentals, revisiting the Java foundation I built in 10th class.

**The Foundation Story:**
Started with Java in 10th class. This was where I first learned what programming actually was. Java became "The Base" - the foundation that would help me understand logic building in every language that came after. It was my first real encounter with programming, and though I didn't understand everything back then, it planted the seed.

**The Reality Check:**
12th was done in May 2024, and I realized I needed to retrace my steps. Time to go back to the basics and actually understand what I was doing instead of just copying code. Java was still there, waiting for me to truly understand its power. This time, I was determined to build on that foundation properly.

## First Real Coding Experience
**Duration:** June 2024  
**Title:** A 4GB DDR3 Laptop High on BlueJ IDE  
**Subtitle:** The Snake Game That Started Everything  
**Summary:** Built my first GUI application on limited hardware - a snake game that actually worked!

**The Struggle Was Real:**
Had this 4GB DDR3 laptop and was high on BlueJ IDE. Tried GUI for the first time and didn't understand shit, but somehow still made a moving snake game with keys. When it moved over fruit, it would eat and give random points. 

It wasn't pretty, but it WORKED. That feeling when your code actually does something visual - that's when I knew I was hooked.

**What I Built:**
- Moving snake game with keyboard controls
- Fruit eating mechanism
- Random point system
- All on a potato laptop with BlueJ

## The Python Switch
**Duration:** June 2024  
**Title:** Got Overwhelmed By Java's OOP  
**Subtitle:** Switched To Python  
**Summary:** Java's object-oriented programming became too much, so I made the switch to Python for its simpler syntax.

**The Overwhelm:**
Java's OOP was just too much for my brain at that time. Classes, objects, inheritance - it all felt like rocket science. So I switched to Python thinking it would be easier.

**The Python Journey:**
Learnt basic Python from Harry's playlist. Followed it till functions, then fell short. Classic me - starting strong then losing steam halfway through. But hey, at least I learned the basics!

**Then Came TKinter:**
Learnt TKinter because I had to do at least some *Tinkering* with GUI. See what I did there? 

REMADE the snake game but with better assets and a bit better understanding of logics alongside it. Progress!

## College Prep Mode
**Duration:** July 2024  
**Title:** Got To Know The College Syllabus  
**Subtitle:** Before College Starts  
**Summary:** Discovered that C programming was in the 1st semester curriculum, so I decided to get ahead of the game and prepare myself.

**The Preparation:**
Got to know we have C language in 1st semester curriculum before college started in July 2024. Time to get ahead of the game! I was excited but also nervous - C seemed like a completely different beast compared to Java and Python.

**The Research Phase:**
Started looking up what C programming was all about. Heard it was more low-level, closer to the machine. That sounded both scary and exciting at the same time. Decided I wasn't going to walk into college unprepared this time.

---

## C Programming Marathon
**Duration:** August 2024  
**Title:** Started Learning C Programming  
**Subtitle:** Harry's 10 Hour Marathon Including 10 Chapters  
**Summary:** Dedicated two weeks to properly learning C programming, and got my first proper laptop!

**The Game Changer:**
GOT MY FIRST OWN LAPTOP - DELL G15 5530! No more struggling with that 4GB potato.

**The Learning Sprint:**
Started learning C programming with Harry's 10-hour marathon covering 10 chapters. Learnt it properly - gave complete concentration and finished in 2 weeks with proper code notes and assignments completed. Old Java knowledge helped A LOT in logic building.

**The Confusion:**
Didn't understand the use of pointers and file management but still learnt it properly. Thought it might be useful in the future (it really was!).

**The GUI Reality Check:**
After completing C, thought to do some GUI again. Found out C doesn't have GUI on their own like Java. **CRIED**

## Web Devlopnent Discovery
**Duration:** August 2024  
**Title:** Thought Of A Coping Mechanism  
**Subtitle:** Got To Know WEB - HTML, CSS, JS (The Trio)  
**Summary:** Discovered web development as an alternative to desktop GUI programming.

**The Web Revelation:**
Since C didn't have GUI, I needed a coping mechanism. Got to know about web development - HTML, CSS, JS (The Trio).

**Snake Game: Web Edition:**
REMADE THE SNAKE GAME AGAINNN! This time with a tutorial from Harry. 

NOTE: I didn't know JS but still coded on. BIGGEST MISTAKE.

**The Modifications:**
Made modifications to the code - removed the snake self-dying feature properly. Didn't like that ever in Nokia phones! Made it, learnt that it won't run anywhere else without *deployment*.

**First Deployment:**
Learnt Github and Github Pages. Hosted my first snake game on 20 August 2024. That feeling of having something live on the internet - priceless!

---

## The Reality Check
**Duration:** August 2024  
**Title:** Thought To Make A Chat App Directly  
**Subtitle:** Yes Too Passionate, Got A Good Reality Check XD  
**Summary:** Attempted to build a chat app without proper knowledge - learned some hard lessons about scope and complexity.

**The Overambition:**
Thought to make a chat app directly. Yes, too passionate, got a good reality check XD.

**The Copy-Paste Disaster:**
Copied the code from a YouTuber, didn't learn shit. SOCKET.IO became trauma. TRIED DEPLOYING IT ON GITHUB STATIC PAGES AS WELL (I know I was genius).

**The AI Dependency:**
Got AI dependent with JS, scared of it as well, and stayed there.

---

## College Life Begins
**Duration:** September 2024  
**Title:** College Started  
**Subtitle:** Time to be the cool guy  
**Summary:** Started college and immediately tried to establish myself as the tech-savvy student with some web projects.

**The Cool Guy Move:**
Made static web pages for notes for the classroom - just static pages with links to notes PDFs on Drive. YESSS, just to be that cool guy. Everyone was like "Wow, how did you make this?" and I felt like a wizard.

**The Designer Side:**
Also made a Tic Tac Toe game - basic stuff to show the designer perspective of mine. Used some fancy CSS animations and gradients to make it look COOL. It wasn't much, but it was mine.

**The College Vibe:**
College was different. Everyone was trying to figure out their thing, and I had already found mine - or so I thought. Little did I know, the real journey was just beginning.

---

## Mobile Development Attempt
**Duration:** October 2024  
**Title:** Explored A Bit More  
**Subtitle:** Tried Android Studio  
**Summary:** Attempted mobile development but ran into hardware limitations, then explored game development as an alternative.

**The Android Studio Reality:**
Tried Android Studio. Laptop said "Calm down, 8GB RAM won't let you run it hehehe." The emulator was slower than my grandma walking upstairs. Frustrating as hell!

**The Game Development Phase:**
I wanted to make an application for mobile or desktop - like standalone applications. For that, shifted towards Unity and Unreal, ran them and made few ooga booga shit games, made their APKs. (To feel COOL, of course!)

**The Learning Curve:**
Unity was overwhelming with all its components and GameObjects. Unreal was even worse - looked like NASA's control panel. But hey, I made some games that actually worked! They were terrible, but they were MINE.

---

## Web Dev Return
**Duration:** November-December 2024  
**Title:** Got Back to the Web Again  
**Subtitle:** Now with better understanding of HTML CSS  
**Summary:** Returned to web development with improved skills and started building more sophisticated projects.

**The Return:**
Got back to the web again, now with better understanding of HTML CSS. Made few ooga booga AI-generated applications in December 2024.

**The Gallery Project:**
Made a Gallery Application (HTML, CSS, JS) in December. Thought "WOWOW So COOL!" - letting my images be accessed via web link.

**The Learning Shift:**
Started learning HTML CSS properly - like actually learning and not just brainrot vibe coding.

---

## Backend Reality Check
**Duration:** January 2025  
**Title:** The Google Drive Iframe Disaster  
**Subtitle:** Got A Good Reality Check  
**Summary:** Tried to iframe images from Google Drive, learned about backend necessity the hard way.

**The Stupid Attempt:**
January 2025 - tried to iframe the image in Google Drive on gallery. (Yes, I know, too STUPID!)

**The Reality Hit:**
Got to know I can't - I need my own backend. *CRIED* - scared of JS already, backend made my nerves wrack. Got a good reality check and went back to my limits.

**The Practical Solution:**
Made basic projects to solve mini problems in my life. A Pocketbank website with localStorage to manage my finances with transaction history.

---

## Portfolio and React Discovery
**Duration:** February 2025  
**Title:** Thought I Am So COOL  
**Subtitle:** Why Not Make A Portfolio  
**Summary:** Built my first portfolio and discovered React, though I didn't understand how it worked.

**The Portfolio:**
Made it using moving gradients animation and CUSTOM RENDERING WITH OBJECTS *Important* (learnt it newly and thought it was super COOL!)

**React Discovery:**
Learnt something like React exists. DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SHIT HOW IT WORKS AND HOW THEY ACTUALLY COMPILE EVERYTHING.

**The Typequest Project:**
Made a web application using it - Typequest (yes, to be more COOL I tried to make my own typing application). Also yes, I knew nothing of React, just vibe coded using free ChatGPT (it was truly PAIN).

---

## React Learning Phase
**Duration:** March 2025  
**Title:** Learnt React (OOGA BOOGA TYPE)  
**Subtitle:** 2 A.M. Binge Video Type  
**Summary:** Finally learned React properly through late-night binge sessions and built a maze game.

**The Binge Learning:**
2 A.M. binge video type learning. Thought I knew everything after that. (No I Didn't)

**The Quickmaze Project:**
Made another React+Vite app (didn't even know what's Vite). Quickmaze - a maze game where each move decreases points. (Own thought idea BTW!)

**Python One-Shot:**
2nd sem started, one-shotted Python learning. C paid off - didn't even need any efforts.

**The Refactoring Phase:**
Started refactoring CSS and designing of all applications to look more COOL. End March.

---

## The Engineering Breakthrough
**Duration:** April 2025  
**Title:** An Engineer's Breakthrough  
**Subtitle:** Laid the foundation of Academic Archive  
**Summary:** Had a major breakthrough in understanding APIs and built a sophisticated file management system, plus first hackathon experience.

**The Problem:**
I thought of the issue I faced with Google Drive not being able to link in frontend and didn't know shit about backend.

**The Solution:**
Thought - Github does allow files to be loaded from same repository. QUICK QUICK QUICK... let's check, does it allow another repository data to be accessed? YES!? WOW with *API* I can... LEARNT RESTful APIs.

**The Architecture:**
Made two repositories - one the frontend, one the database. Database structure like tree folders inside folders. Made an entire rendering engine for it with each folder separate API request for files and rendered them in archive... MASSIVE BREAKTHROUGH for me.

NOTE: I still didn't know JS properly, vibes on vibes, still made it work!

**First Hackathon - BBD Kalpathon:**
FIRST HACKATHON EXPERIENCE. Wanted to make a FAQ chatbot. DIDN'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT AI AS WELL. Learnt Gemini provides FREE API, tried vibe coding, FAILED a lot, still AI worked. Engineering mindset kicked in - teammate suggested Google Sheets for data. RAG system built with junkyard tech stack. API stopped working during judging. Boom! LOST!

**More Projects:**
Made EXPRESS PDF for image to PDF conversion and Resume Crafter for live PDF editing. (DIDN'T KNOW SHIT OF JS PROPERLY BUT STILL GOT HOLD OF IT DUE TO SO MANY PROJECTS)

---

## JavaScript Mastery
**Duration:** May 2025  
**Title:** IT'S JS TIME!  
**Subtitle:** 2 Weeks Break On Chai  
**Summary:** Finally dedicated time to properly learn JavaScript through Chai Aur Code playlist with proper consistency and notes.

**The Proper Learning:**
Chai Aur Code playlist complete. Bingewatched with proper code and notes organized via sections, just like I learnt C - proper consistency. This time I wasn't going to half-ass it like before.

**The Breakthrough Moment:**
Everything started clicking! Closures, promises, async/await - concepts that seemed like black magic before suddenly made sense. I was finally understanding what I was writing instead of just copying.

**The PTSD Skip:**
(LEFT OOPs in it as well because JAVA nightmares were PTSD for me)

**The Result:**
JS LEARNT, NOW DEVELOPMENT ON PEAK! Finally felt confident enough to build real applications without constantly googling basic syntax.

---

## Optimization Phase
**Duration:** June 2025  
**Title:** COMEBACK ON JUNE 2025  
**Subtitle:** Updated the archive rendering engine  
**Summary:** Applied newfound JavaScript knowledge to optimize existing projects significantly and add new features.

**The Optimization:**
Updated the archive rendering engine from folder to folder DFS rendering to layer by layer via Github hashes BFS rendering. The difference was night and day!

**The Performance Boost:**
Improved API requests from 60+ to just 3 to 5 per render - actual optimizations! Users could finally browse through files without waiting forever. Added multiple repositories feature, added custom repository addition feature, recent files, recent file view inside models and much more.

**The Satisfaction:**
This was the first time I felt like a real developer. Not just copying code, but actually understanding performance bottlenecks and solving them. The Academic Archive was finally becoming something I was proud of.

---

## Full Stack Journey
**Duration:** July 2025  
**Title:** BACKEND Jump  
**Subtitle:** Node JS, Express, React, MongoDB  
**Summary:** Finally made the jump to backend development and became a full-stack developer with proper tech stack knowledge.

**The Stack:**
- Node JS learnt - finally understood server-side JavaScript
- Express learnt - routing and middleware made sense
- Known React - revisited and done properly this time
- MongoDB learnt - NoSQL databases were actually cool

**The Full Stack Feeling:**
For the first time, I could build complete applications from database to frontend. No more "I need a backend developer" excuses. I WAS the backend developer!

**Hackathon Burst:**
Multiple hackathons participation with proper development skills as well as designing skills. MADE SIGNIFICANT FULL STACK PROJECTS. Continuous month grind. Finally felt like I belonged in the developer community.
